If your answer to any of these questions is “yes” then the Hobby Journal is the solution. This wonderful application provides a great variety of functions to the users. After registration and profile making, you can add an array of common hobbies to your own collection, you can set the activity’s date, length and even add notes. If you changed your mind or made a mistake, you can also delete these activities. If you can’t find one of your beloved hobbies in the hobby list, then you can add new hobbies as a logged in user. You can set the name, description, picture, and category of the new hobby. If you find this application useful and you would like to recommend it one of your foreigner friends, language barriers aren’t a problem. If they don’t speak Hungarian, they can easily change the language to English. You can filter the hobbies based on categories; this allows you to easily find hobbies that interest you. If you have created a hobby incorrectly, there is an option to delete it. You can delete not only the hobbies you have created but also the other hobbies from your own hobbies collection, along with all associated activities. Even if you lose internet connection, the website remains functional offline with reduced features. You can still browse hobbies, filter them by category, review your own hobbies, or check activities within each hobby."
